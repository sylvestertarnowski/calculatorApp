# calculatorApp

This is a simple calculator app.

Goal of this project:

1. Learn how to create a web app that does basic calculations for the user.

2. App will have fully functional GUI.

3. Clickable buttons like on a regular calculator.

4. Possibly add the ability to input the numbers and performing the operations using keyboard buttons.

5. Make it so that it's usable - it does not have to be graphically super nice (I am not a graphic designer).

6. The underlying goal is to learn JavaScript better (yay!).

If someone stumbles here by any accident, please do let me know what I could have done better,
or how could I optimise it better.

Cheers!
